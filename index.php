             Flexible work hours is a highly sought-after benefit that will greatly enhance the internship experience for students. This benefit allows interns to have more control over their schedules and work around their personal commitments, such as school or family responsibilities. With flexible work hours, interns will choose to work during the hours that are most productive for them, which will lead to increased job satisfaction and motivation. Additionally, this benefit will help reduce stress and burnout, as interns are not confined to a strict schedule that may not work for their individual needs. Ultimately, flexible work hours will promote a better work-life balance and allow interns to focus on developing their skills and gaining valuable experience.</p>
